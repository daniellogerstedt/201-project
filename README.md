# Technical Requirements (MVP):
•	Take text and encrypt it or decrypt it based on user needs (2 buttons and text fields)
•	Use HTML/CSS/Javascript
•	Use all elements accumulating to what we have learned so far (forms, object constructors, loops, a well thought our UI/UX, manipulate the DOM, use animations, use charts, use localStorage, using a lib)
•	Load onto live GitHubPage
•	Show up every day and summarize problems, meet with Brian, and touch base

# Stretch goals:
•	Make about us page
•	Add hidden easter eggs
•	Encode based on key
